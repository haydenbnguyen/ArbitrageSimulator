# Statistical Arbitrage Strategy Simulator

This project simulates a market-neutral pair trading strategy (statistical arbitrage) in Python. It is designed for research, backtesting, and educational purposes.

## Features
- Simulate pair trading strategies on historical price data
- Market-neutral portfolio construction
- Performance metrics and visualization
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the simulator:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- `main.py` — Entry point for running simulations
- `strategy.py` — Core logic for pair trading strategy
- `data.py` — Data loading and preprocessing
- `analysis.py` — Performance analysis and visualization
